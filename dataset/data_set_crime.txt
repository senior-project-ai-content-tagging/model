The wounds, if proven to know what is caused by Not in the duties that the institute will do as a jigsaw that is taken in the picture But the image that is suspected whether the wounds are torn in the bones or not. I did not find it. But can tell whether the wound was born before or after Which has already been in the clarification report The first corpse in the brought up the white watermelon. But when immersed in the formalin, it makes the trace clearer Therefore, the torn wound is not a torn wound. As a result, today was very narrow. Col. Songsak said that we have received the matter from March 14, on the 15th meeting before the 2nd resolution under the law. Forensic Science Services 2016, which stipulates that if there is a request to inspect the 2nd round into the institute, must accept So as not to be a conflict with the first examination This time, it was completed.

Not an inquiry official We then sent the information to relatives. When the first opinion came out, the second time must not be the same. But to review that According to academic principles Legal procedure or not Which we have done completely, which we have done the 2nd inspection process for 20 years, straightforward and transparent. Asst. Prof. Worawee said that in the first inspection is considered to have a standard that makes answers to the question. Almost all In the second round, just stressing that the first question is or not. For the wound on the leg Still can't answer how it happened In which the police will simulate the occurrence of wounds to various objects May be a boat fan To compare with the wound As for the inspection of alcohol, it is usually dead. Because alcohol will be driven from breathing Therefore, the inspection of the body will change a little for urea, which is considered an element in the urine. If there is urine in the sanitary pad, it will be detected but cannot be detected and the said sheet is soaked in water. Urea may be washed into the lawyer Decha, saying that this document must be consulted with the police whether it will be useful to report the charges or not. Caused by intent or negligence And the result is different from the first examination? In which he had not yet found a change in significantly But have to consult with the doctor about the wound 22 points. For the inspection, it was found that the forensic police hospital is considered international standards. Everything is neat But the wound may be called new Considered useful But must look thoroughly Because the corpse is considered a witness Must see if there are signs of attack or not If there is, it must be compared to the GPS environment in order to report the charges of the intention of killing. The wound is not yet said to be caused by the intention or not. It is expected that there will be no repeated proof 3 since he was a lawyer. But this case is probably enough. The lawyer Decha said that Kornwiwan has the news that the police request the court to issue an arrest warrant for people on the boat and the court dismissed the request that it is not true. Because the police probably didn't do anything to break the face But believe that soon There may be an arrest warrant or an additional allegation. May be lifted at all Or only one person left

As the vice president of the sub -committee and the media, the search warrant of the Criminal Court Invade the search at the Blue Dragon Lottery Company Limited and accused of selling online lotteries over the price. By collecting another service fee of 20-30 baht, which is the cause of expensive lotteries Until becoming famous throughout the country In addition, many branches of the company cause the company to be damaged in business operations. And the reputation of the company on March 25, by the Tampachall, said that in each draw The Government Lottery Office Will allocate 100 million lottery tallos into 2 systems, which are allocated to 31 million distributors for sale to Association/Organization/Foundation , Small people and the disabled. Part 2 will allocate 69 million pre-reservations for sale to Small registrar by receiving the lottery at the post office When the lotteries are allocated into both systems, there will be rights that are eligible. And without the rights in the quota of the lottery office Will sell the lotteries to small traders In order to be sold in various locations such as flea markets in front of the gas station, which is seen until familiar But the problems that occur, such as buyers, lottery numbers that are hard to buy If it is a lucky number, it will be carried by the seller. If not sold out, it is a burden that traders have to buy by themselves, resulting in losses. Assembled in the past several years Occupational -19 epidemic, people do not come out to buy lotteries. Because avoiding touch is the reason that the lottery is not sold out Causing small traders to experience a lot of losses. For this reason They therefore think of ways to reach lottery buyers by selling online. To facilitate both the buyer and the seller called "the Blue Dragon Platform" by the small seller, bringing the lottery in the hand to the blue dragon company to scan or take a picture to sell in the platform. When the scan is finished The blue dragon company will keep these lotteries in the safe. To prevent traders from selling lotteries to duplicate The said lottery is still the ownership of each seller. The Blue Dragon Company benefits as a lottery scanning for no more than 5 baht. When the lottery has been scanned. Will appear on the blue dragon platform Buyers can choose to buy the desired lottery number directly from the seller. Currently, there are more than 39,000 lottery sellers in the sky dragon platform. The seller determines the price. The buyer will choose to buy lotteries from any seller as satisfied. When the purchase is agreed successfully, the buyer will transfer the lottery tickets directly into the seller's bank account. Which the Blue Dragon Company is not involved in determining the lottery price, but the Blue Dragon Company will only receive a lottery stall rental And when the buyer agreed to buy any lottery That lottery will be eliminated immediately. Cannot be traded again In addition, when the lottery is won Online platform system will have an automatic SMS alert to buyers. As for the prize -ups, 2 ways can be able to get a lottery tickets that have been rewarded by the Blue Dragon Company without any service charges at all, or the Blue Dragon Company increases the prize money. And transfer money to the buyer Which the company Will charge the service at the rate of 2 percent Of the award -winning amount In this way, there are a lot of lottery buyers who won the service. The company would like to emphasize that the accusation of the Blue Dragon Company is the cause of the expensive lottery. Inevitably unfair to the company, because in the past, everyone already knew that According to the lottery panel at the entrance of the alley All sell the lottery More than the price together Which did not even pass the blue dragon platform

If you have to go to the police hospital, then call to ask the mother how it is. Eat and vomit out. The first day that I got to eat and vomit. Sleep and wake up, dizzy, then lie down That day, calling to talk, talk, do not know about it. Would like to say that The trainee will have to buy food, drinking water to leave the trainer. Please be careful. Because some people only know for a few days, they may think badly to us. Be careful.
