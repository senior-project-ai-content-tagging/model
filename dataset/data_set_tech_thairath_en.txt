After an earlier California court ruling, Apple and Epic Games have filed a lawsuit against Apple and Epic Games over the case that Epic Games has put a channel to buy products within Fortnite with its own payment system, superimposed on Apple's app store platform, which does not allow developers to create external payment channels, but only through Apple. The dispute was considered in September, although some of the areas that Epic Games won was that Epic was able to create its own payment gateway. For example, the court agreed with Apple to ban the resumption of Fortnite games on the app store, until Epic failed to show the court that Apple had a monopoly on the app store from the above points, allowing Apple to continue banning Fortnite from appearing on the app store. There's been a lot of direction, including by shutting down the payment system within Fortnite to allow the game to return to the app store. Sweetney Instead, Apple has banned Fortnite until the lawsuit is over, making it possible that Fortnite is likely to be banned from the app store for at least five years.

"Sethapong" suggests balancing satellite business for the best interest of the country.|"Satellite orbit" is not the sovereignty of any country. Suggested the liberalization of competition for satellite business with appropriateness and balance for the best interest of the country on October 5, 2021. List of MPs of the Bhumjaithai Party As a former Vice Chairman of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) and former Chairman of the Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), he wrote an article about the issuance of business licenses to Thaicom Co., Ltd. in 2012. Article II, which Thailand signed with the treaty on January 27, 1967, states that in deep space, including the moon, stars, all objects in space, the universe is in deep space. It is not under sovereignty or possession by any one country. This includes the orbit of the Earth's orbital satellites/orbits of the Earth's equators, which are more than 350,000 kilometers above the Earth's equator. In other words, the satellite orbit is at 120 or 78.5 degrees East, which Thailand is permitted to use based on tea's consensus." Col. Sethapong identified Col. Sethapong. It further stated that the use of orbital satellites is therefore subject to mutual agreement on the basis of "first come first serve". The government agency that acts as the ITU Admin for Thailand, namely the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), before becoming the current Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (DES), will enter the filing process with several steps and must coordinate frequencycy. When to send a new satellite up with All operations, including launching satellites into orbit, must be completed within 7 years from the start of the process. When the Filing process is complete, you can click Ok "However, this does not mean that the orbital rights are owned, owned, or blocked from use by other Member States, so if other Member States wish to conduct space activities at that orbit and do not affect the rights of members with space objects in the same orbit, they can do so." Dr. Sethapong He said the auction of Thailand's previous satellites was a satellite orbit owned by Thailand that was allocated by the ITU. Explain that, in accordance with the principles of the Mutual Space Use Treaty, It does not give a country sovereignty over satellite orbit. Therefore, satellite orbit is not under the possession of Thailand or the Thai government. The principle is as follows: Thailand or The Thai Government Satellite orbits cannot be auctioned to raise revenue for the state. Therefore, the auction in satellite business in 1991 was an auction to allow the winner to receive monopoly protection for 8 years (Sep 34 - Sep 42) and a license to operate communication satellites for 30 years (Sep 34 - Sep 21). The winner of the auction must: Make a proposal for revenue sharing to provide a minimum income guarantee to the state in the amount of 1,415 million baht. Throughout the life of the concession, the state uses satellite circuits in the C-Band 1 transponder band throughout the life of the concession contract without compensation. The package consists of the status of the orbital access rights that are both in the process of being completed and in progress. to put the satellite into orbit at the specified time." Dr. Sethapong Identify the view that Thailand is suitable for satellite auctions because it will bring the greatest benefits to the country. Dr. Sethapong It said it was important to understand the country's interests in the context of the current liberalization of telecommunications. It is different from the interests of the country. Under exclusive state monopoly, which focuses primarily on the benefits to the state. Therefore, the country's interests in telecommunications today must balance both the interests of the state. Benefits of the telecommunications industry and the benefits of consumers Auctions in Satellite Business Month Sep 1991 may have an impact on the benefits of the industry and the interests of consumers. This is because the minimum pricing in the auction focuses on generating the highest revenue for the government, but is not in line with industry conditions, as it will hinder the satellite from being put into orbit within the ITU's specified timeframe. The right to consider moving to other countries and if Thailand wants to re-apply for this orbital right. "In the context of Thailand's current telecommunications business, under the liberalization of appropriate and balanced competition, it will be vital for the benefit of consumers. Reducing restrictions on entry into competitive markets is essential, so the operation to acquire orbital licenses should be liberalized to any operator. There is no limit to the number of market players, other than filing rights pending in the transition from monopoly to liberalization. If entrepreneurs consider that other orbits are suitable for their own business operations, they can start filing with the "First Come, First Serve" principle in line with the ITU's method of operation, which will benefit the country."

5 Chinese students sue Apple for not including iPhone 12 charger Chinese netizens go viral nationwide|Five Chinese students filed a lawsuit against Apple for not including a charger inside the iPhone 12's product box last May, which went viral on Chinese social media. The Times said in May that five Chinese students filed a complaint with the People's Court in Dongcheng District in Beijing. They want Apple to include a charger in the device and to be responsible for a service charge of 100 yuan, as well as all litigation costs, after the issue is recognized by the people of China. As a result, internet citizens in China are very interested in the case. Some of them think that not including the charger is no different from being a defective product, but some argue that Apple has already informed in advance that the product will not include a charger. The story has been read more than 340 million times on Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter, and Apple's legal representative clarified that the charger is not in a sales contract between Apple and its customers. He also said that Apple decided not to include the charger because it was concerned about protecting the environment and reducing the use of plastic packaging. Lawyers in China told the Global Times that if a smartphone doesn't have a charger, it won't work normally. So, then, this is a violation of the previous service contract. In China, there used to be a comparable case: an incident in which a student from a Chinese university filed a lawsuit against Shanghai Disney Resort because the resort prohibited outside food from entering the park. After all, in this case, Disney Resort had to pay compensation of 50 yuan. Apple fined $2 million for not including iPhone 12 charger.Source: Global TimesSPONSORED
TSC Space Exploration Project Aiming to orbit the moon within 7 years|"Anek". TSC Big Space Exploration Project Aiming to orbit the moon in the next 7 years Thailand is believed to be the fifth country in Asia to produce a spacecraft to the moon. Identify several new startups to produce spacecraft parts, driving an economy worth up to 100 trillion baht. The best parallel walk on October 28, 2021 Dr. Sarun Posayajinda Director, National Astronomical Research Institute The Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MOE) mentioned the TSC project or Thai Space Consortium under the "12-month 12-good project with Minister Enok". At one point, the TSC project was Thailand's largest space exploration project, orbiting the moon in the next seven years. This makes the United States a permanent leader in science and technology. Even computers have evolved. Today, we're getting closer to space. We take advantage of space. In the old days, it took a long time to know foreign news. Later, other benefits were used, such as using GPS from satellites. Space is also the future of humanity, exploring planets elsewhere, not confined to one planet. Many years ago, Elonmustt frequently said that humans colonized Mars, whose resources were very close to Earth. This has been asked a lot. He thinks there must be a group of humans who have to travel elsewhere, and the use of Mars still has a lot that we can't imagine, Dr. Sarun continued, "For the TSC project, the first satellite we are designing. Imaging equipment is installed. These devices, when attached to our existing satellites, can be used to quickly identify cultivation and troubleshoot problems. It can classify, analyze, solve plant problems. In addition, we will know the resources under the earth. We can develop satellites that use radar and operate in remote interference mode. We have a team of advanced engineering capabilities, and in 10 years we make satellites that will have enormous spatial management capabilities SPONSORED"Going to the moon is not going for prestige, on the moon there can be enormous resources. If we could send a spacecraft into orbit around the moon, we would be able to do it. We will have a lot of information. If Thailand were to start a space program in addition to sending satellites orbiting the Earth, it would not be able to do so. The first point is the Moon, because technology is not easy, we have to learn various techniques to control and know the location of the satellite craft, and the next target is Mars. These projects are not throwing budgets into space, but we are throwing budgets into people to increase the talent and potential of Thai people. Dr. Sarun said that the policy of Mr. Enok Laothamthat The Minister is focused on transforming Thailand into an innovative country. It is envisaged that this project will make Thailand soar to the top. Thailand aims to become the fifth country in Asia to produce a spacecraft and orbit the moon. It's about exploring the moon. What does Thailand do? A team of hundreds of engineers developed their potential. University apprentices gain experience and develop together. Scientists will get the benefits of the data obtained from the survey. Today, we have a control station and receive thaisot (Sriracha), Thaicom satellite, and THEOS, a remote sensing satellite to explore Thailand's natural resources. At the same time, there is also the NACSAT satellite of King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, the first BCCSAT-1 satellite of Thai children from Bangkok Christian School. We have agencies, but we still lack the watershed: designing and building these devices will lead to the emergence of many types of startups in Thailand. In order to produce various parts to build a spacecraft. This makes it possible to create a lot of business value for startups in Thailand. If we build our economy in this space industry, we will be able to develop people in the best possible way. Therefore, we need a space program to develop the country's potential, which also brings great value," Dr. Sarun said.

Facebook renamed Dr. Meen analyzes the name, sum, answer. Finance Profits  |Recently, I would say that the news that is as popular as the opening of the country is the change of the name of the global social media company that is ranked in the top 3 in the world. Like Facebook, it's a great opportunity. Dr. Meen, Professor Attapol, will analyze this social media holistically, namely both the name Facebook, both old and new, the name Meta, both the owner's name, what star it fell into. The company has gone a long way, including a new logo. Mark Zuckerberg, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Facebook and born May 14, 1984- Mark's birthday is considered a birthday of success because it is a young Taurus or Taurus boy who is very patient, patient and overcomes all obstacles for a great goal. Mars, fire element, makes it very good to work or business abroad- Zuckerberg combines ok, sun influence, fire element, suitable for setting up own company. You don't have to be a subordinate. - If you analyze the 4 universal elements, you can see that it is a fire element in both the first and last names, this is not contradictory and causes great confidence, confidence and creativity. The old name is Facebook, which sums up Saturn. And it's the feng shui of the 8th century. 10 years and 10 years from now because of agility and adaptability. The new name is Meta, the sum is Mercury, it is a financial star and a negotiating star, agile like a water element, can go everywhere, is friendly with the same thing, is communication, but meets the needs of money more than before, should be much more profitable. Another interesting term is that the Earth Metaverse also forms the number of Saturn. It can be seen that even after the name change from Facebook to Meta, the international numerology for business is considered better and not worse because it is still considered a friendly pair between the original star Saturn that is suitable for the Internet, but the new sum of Meta is Mercury. In terms of the business logo, the same color is blue, it is Venus that focuses on customer care, but has a gimmick, it is adjusted to Infinity with a more stable base, like an eye and a device for wearing on the head, emphasizing VR, future vision, and the eternal meaning of the Infinity mark.

No creaking sound. The weight of the 1.43 kilograms is not super light, but it is not very heavy. It's not a bad idea. The typing time is good enough to bounce against the fingers. Although dragging your finger on the touchpad is not very fluid, it is considered that the touchpad can be used instead of using a mouse.

If you use a 90Hz refresh rate, the battery will last for approximately 7-8 hours, then it will be necessary to call for an adapter to renew the battery. If the battery is fully charged, it can be 100 percent charged for about an hour. The keyboard typing experience of the Huawei MateBook 14s is ok, although it doesn't impress the touchpad part very much. Gamers should be pleased enough. For those who are working in the line of work, it is a solution Because the efficiency of work is organized is nimble, overhauled to work outside the home (if necessary) can be done Because the machine does not have a weight that cannot be carried In case of wanting to take a notebook to watch video content and other entertainment Is a good answer Especially sports broadcasts that release high FPS streams will find fluidity Making watching sports much more fun for the starting price may be a little higher at 40,990 baht.

Calls for Mark Zuckerberg to resign from CEO and allow people interested in online safety to pick up the sticks, rather than creating a metaverse, said Frances Haugen, facebook's former product manager. Facebook last month called on Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to resign as CEO of the company. Speaking at a web summit held in Lisbon, Portugal, Haugen said facebook business would improve. When they have leaders who are more interested in online security than they are today, while her views on rebranding from Facebook to the Meta are preparing for the metaverse, they're looking forward to it. She believes Facebook should be more expeditious in addressing current issues instead of investing in the metaverse, according to a document Frances Haugen released to Congress showing that what Facebook needs to do is build a basic security system. The examples in the documents that Haugen presented would include Instagram, which has created mental health problems for teenagers, failures to deal with fake news, especially from 2016 onwards, hate speeches, and the January 2021 Washington riots. We're working on $5 billion for safety and security throughout 2021, which is even more than any other tech company. A spokesperson for Meta added that security, as Frances Haugen mentioned, is something that can be done at the same time. In other words, Facebook can continue to build the metaverse and, on the other hand, create online security at the same time.

Facebook failed to give Verified badge to Elon Musk's fake fan page|Facebook, the world's largest social media platform Make a big mistake by giving a blue check mark or Verified mark to a fan page disguised as Elon. Musk was an incredible mistake by Facebook. When they gave Elon Musk's fans a blue check mark that confirmed that this was a real public account to Elon Musk's fan page, it was only because Elon Musk had long since retired from Facebook. At the same time, the fan page still has only 1.53 lakh followers, which is very small. Compared to Elon Musk's worldwide fame, especially on Twitter, which has 61.9 million followers. The fan page didn't start with Elon Musk's fake fan page status, but has been changing its name continuously since 2019. It is interesting to see why Facebook gives the page a blue check mark status, because in fact, it is not easy to get the Verified mark because it has to be submitted along with various identification documents. If you look at the movements on the page, there are almost no posts on the page, while the URL of the fan page, which is called https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffic, is likely to be detected as fake. It doesn't seem to be official in the slightest, which raises doubts about how Facebook missed it. Elon Musk's fake fan page is also considered a scam, as one status (which has been deleted) says that if anyone reads this status, transfer $1,000 to his account with bitcoin. Musk says this. It is either because Facebook removed the fan page from the system or shut down the page by the owner of the fan page disguised as Elon Musk.

Giving opportunities for young people to build business through Start Up as the basis of Thailand's future on November 4, 2021 Dr. Sethapong Malisuwan List of MPs of the Bhumjaithai Party As Vice Chairman of the Communications Commission Telecommunications and Digital Economy and Society (KMTH DES) Speaking at the Redefine Businesses with 5G Forum 2021 under the theme "Driving 5G in Thailand sustainably", He said that driving 5G in Thailand to have a sustainable impact must be looked at in many dimensions. We need to understand 5G first. Better communication is no longer important because communication systems have changed their perspective. Enter the world of analytics As the analysis becomes more complicated Being smarter will lead to rapid change. For example, in organizations, people's work. 5G isn't just about adding 1G from 4G, as 5G has made billions of sensor changes around the world connected. Artificial intelligence (AI) will help analyze more and more predictions of the future. THEREFORE, 5G IS NOT THE SAME AS 3G OR 4G SPONSORED, PROF. SETTHAPONG SAID THAT FOR THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF 5G, TELECOM OPERATORS ARE NOT ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE BUILT COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS FOR THE PEOPLE, BUT HAVE CHANGED THEIR ROLES. If it is to drive effectively and in relation to the development of that country. Service providers must be consultants, have automated corporate links to organizations, and provide transition advice to organizations in both the public and private sectors. Equipment manufacturers also have to change their roles to help service providers. Modern equipment and technology can be equipped with the world of the future, and the workplace will change. Therefore, all of this needs to be discussed and mentored by both the public and private sectors to be able to digitize effectively and successfully. The NBTC and the Ministry of Digital Affairs must try not to impose too many mandatory rules that make it impossible to drive technology. This is extremely important, governance must be conducive to the development of the country. Develop the economic system, allowing both business and government systems to be harmonized. Move forward effectively. He said that 5G relies on a cloud system, and Thailand is fortunate that our location is suitable and conducive to development, so the EEC must be effectively driven by the ministry and have appropriate support from relevant agencies.  Therefore, the public and private sectors must work together to create a source of experts to make the ecosystem consistent and usable effectively, which can help develop new economies for the country. Therefore, the government must ensure that these children and young people can easily and efficiently build businesses through start-up, 5G and support funding. If the public sector cannot unlock the private sector to integrate or make investments easily, or there are too many obstacles that cannot be lowered, it will not succeed in driving sustainable 5G in Thailand. I hope that all of you in the near future will come together in the form of councils or organizations. To help each other figure out how we can move forward." Dr. Sethapong said.

Huawei looks for new allies, hoping to help break the impasse imposed by U.S. sanctions|Huawei is a manufacturer of famous smartphone brands from China. Prepare to find a way out of U.S. sanctions by looking for new allies. As you know, Huawei smartphones have been sanctioned by the United States, making it currently impossible for Huawei smartphones to use important Google services until the release of its own products in the United States, which is a huge market. It is seeking partners to grant Huawei smartphone design rights to third-party companies to give Huawei access to manufacturing parts and access to U.S. technology, according to Bloomberg. Huawei initially held talks with TD Tech, a brand that partially uses Huawei's designs but sells under its own brand, or even Xnova, a smartphone dealer.

Keep an eye on work trends The careers of the next generation in the next 10 years  |Nowadays, many jobs have been replaced by new technologies and innovations that reflect that digital disruption is not just a trend, but an important issue that will completely change the way humans work. The Futures and Beyond: Navigating Thailand toward 2030 research report titled "Working for the Next 10 Years" to prepare for future changes from the Office for National Statistics in 2020 revealed that there are currently 38.21 million people in the workforce.

There is a high risk of being replaced by automation. THE MOST AFFECTED ARE WORKERS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR, AGRICULTURE AND LOW-SKILLED WORKERS SPONSORED WHEN AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ROBOTICS ARE CHANGING THE EXISTING WORK PATTERNS. The work we do today will be 50-70 percent different. However, when automation, robotics, and humans Having a collaboration will result in more efficient teams and work results. For example, a system that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) will change the way we work in knowledge-oriented fields and professions, such as finance. medicine Leadership, AI laws enhance the work of experts and operating systems to be accurate. Increase efficiency and speed Still, questions about technological ethics will get more attention. In the future, moral issues will be debated, and legislation on the development and use of AI will become a much-discussed issue in the future. Another thing that will follow is the 6G network, which is projected to be 8,000 times faster than 5G. It can significantly accelerate the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as enable intelligent interfaces. It affects more efficient work. It is also expected that the exoskeleton is under extensive development. Although it is designed for different purposes, including medical, industrial, military. But this device will have a significant impact on physical enhancement to future work. And when the world embraces a wide range of skills as the world enters into change. The need for a wide range of skills has also changed. Firstly, stem careers are careers in which employees use their knowledge of science, technology, engineering or mathematics to try to understand how the world works and how to solve problems. The organization will focus on determining the selection of employment based on the skills and abilities available and meet the needs of the job in that position.

The younger generation will prioritize "Valuing Free Time" rather than career growth or salary base growth. Therefore, work goals focus on balancing work and life. Therefore, organizations that want to recruit motivated and committed employees. It is necessary to increase investment in meaning and flexibility in the work of "Gig Economy". In an era where everyone is giggling as technology and the digital world change, many professions have had to adapt. Most organizations have training policies to add new skills needed for the future for employees to use for further work, another thing that is expected to follow is that the "temporary and part-time economy or gig economy", as well as freelance work or project-based contracts will become a normal part of the job market. Employers aim to minimize the number of permanent contracts. For financial reasons, employees are also willing to consider contracts with increased flexibility. However, working under the Gig Economy model is no less interesting because it is a shared economy concept. It emphasizes collaborative work to benefit all parties. In addition to promoting innovation capabilities for the country's SMEs, NIA also focuses on "creating the jobs of the future" by creating a new wave of economies like startups. Currently, NIA has incubated new courses and knowledge such as STEAM or innovative skills needed for NewGen people from students to universities so that they can become "changemakers" in the economic, social, and organizational dimensions. Moreover, innovation opportunities are distributed to the regional level through knowledge linkages. Creating an Innovation Space Funding for potential entrepreneurs These opportunities are all important tools to support the workforce that is about to weather the wave of change that is coming to everyone in the near future.

The situation between Russia and Ukraine As a result, the chipset shortage is exacerbated.|The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to re-emerge the supply chain of chipset production. Market research firm TrendForce has issued an analysis of the conflict situation of Russia and Ukraine. This not only affects international politics, but also has a huge impact on the economy. Especially the production process of technological chipsets, the reason for this is because both Russia and Ukraine. They are exporters of the main raw material used in the chipset production process, neon, which, as both countries launch attacks, will affect the supply of raw materials for feeding into chipset factories next, according to TrendForce. Ukraine supplies nearly 70 percent of the world's purity neon gas to be used to carve circuit boards into silicon wafers. For semiconductor production, even neon gas delivery problems have the potential to stumble down. But chipset production in the short term may not be affected. However, fewer shipments of neon gas than usual have led to higher silicon wafer production prices in recent times. Advanced chipset manufacturing in the United States There is no less reliance on raw materials imported from Russia and Ukraine. If the U.S. government moves to impose additional sanctions on Russia, it will have to do so. The state of Basmoscow could also suspend exports of key raw materials to disrupt U.S. chipset production, said Samsung, a leading South Korean technology company. It has not had an immediate impact, and production continues to operate normally. Samsung There are many ways to get raw materials from different sources, so it is considered good luck. However, Samsung will keep a close eye on this even if it receives raw materials from various channels, but the inevitable thing is that the price of raw materials may rise due to the tension situation.

Flask-San Open your mind for the first time. After the watermelon fell off the boat, he didn't touch his phone (clip).|"Flask-San" opened up for the first time after giving a police statement in the case of "Watermelon-Nida" falling off the boat, clearing all the issues that people suspected. The actress, who did not call her mother because she was not close and thought that she could help at that time from the case of Melon Nida or Pattarathida Patcharaveerapong, 37 years old. While on a speedboat trip with a group of 6 men and women, the incident occurred at around 10.30 pm on the night of February 24, 2022, in the middle of the river between Phibun Songkhram Pier 1 and Rama VII Bridge, Suan Yai. Mueang Nonthaburi Rescuers mobilized a team of divers to search day and night. Finally, miracles don't exist for more than 38 hours at 1:10 p.m. yesterday (Feb. 26). The body of the actress was found floating near the pontoon, which the rescue team used as a command post, according to a news release dated February 27, 2022. Ijsarin Juthasuksawat, Director of Watermelon and San Wisapat Manomayrat A friend who was on the speedboat met with the investigators, after which both Flask and Zan came out for an interview. A reporter by Flask revealed the timeline of what happened, saying that the first was Mr. Po, who owned the boat, who was a long-time friend of ours. Let's meet, let's go. We wanted to meet an old friend, which we went to mobilize friends such as Mo Khae Noi Rong Flask, which was not stuck at work, so we went to invite San Tan because we were afraid of the little people and did not have fun, while Noi Rong himself was also addicted to work, so he told us to go first. We arrived at Lett around 4.45pm and we met 2 other Po friends, who informed us first that he would take his friend with us, which we were ok with, because otherwise he would be the only man in the boat after the cruise to the restaurant. After eating Before returning, everyone went to the toilet, because we didn't see the toilet on the boat, and the distance was not short, but Mo didn't go. Even though we invited because he wasn't in pain, he played with his phone, got out of the restaurant around 2pm, got on the boat, stopped to take photos on the way, and the incident happened at about 4pm, which took a long time. He said that when the watermelon urinated on the stern of the boat, the flask was not seen because we had stopped taking pictures. We were tired, the boat left rama 8 bridge, we were about to enter the shipyard, my friend said that I had a pain to pee. Why didn't I go, and the watermelon said that I wasn't in pain at the time, but I didn't have any pee in my stomach. Why don't we go, the watermelon is still poked, and then he goes back without showing signs that he can't stand it, we don't care, at that time we are only interested in the view, because we wasted a lot of time taking pictures, because the weather is good, the sky is clear, hear the voice again, Xan shouted, which Xan is behind. We were in the front, and Mo walked behind. At the time, we didn't know what was going on. We heard Xan yelling watermelons on the boat, then heard Mr. Job yelling watermelons for the boat, before Mr. Poe broke the steering wheel and turned around. This is the angle that Flask saw when asked Zan: Did you see when the watermelon fell? Zan revealed that the manner in which the watermelon falls is flipping sideways. At that time, he used two hands to hold on his leg, where he was lying on his phone. When asked, Zane I said, we drank a little bit, and the watermelon didn't know if it was drunk. When the incident happened, he walked over and sat down. We haven't said anything yet. When asked if he was wearing a bodysuit that day, Zan asked if he had never urinated in a hurry in a bodysuit, if he ever knew, because if he explained it now, it would be disrespectful, which he did not notice what kind of bodysuit it was. He revealed that from experience in a hurry, it was unconventional, which he had done before, and it was the most convenient, but we don't know if he did that, which he was on the boat, it was clear, no one would take it off completely. Did he tell his friend, and whether the boat was sailing at speed? He didn't tell, everyone looked ahead. You know, it's falling, you know, from Xan. He walked in, sat down, it was very fast, which we believed in, but we didn't see it when our friend fell. At first, he was still wondering if Sanwa was playing anything. When asked who was the driver of the boat, the flask said that he would alternate, which he didn't care about, but we heard Robert standing at the steering wheel, and Poe turned the steering wheel back to search, but he would already be there teaching, which Mr. Poe was friends with, including watermelon. As for the other 2 male friends, we just knew that day because Poe had already said that he would invite his friends with him. We were afraid he was lonely, so we got to know each other on the boat that day. But we talked to Po and Brother Robert about more business with Job Least Flask also confirmed that Po owned the boat and then Po invited us to the boat, so we invited a friend that we are close to, which Tig Melon Noi Rong would already make an appointment, but when Po came in, we chose to go with Po because it was quite safe and personal. Apologies to everyone who didn't speak out. We're focusing on a friend (crying). We are still confused about what to feel, Flask wants to cry for Mo, but Flask himself has to sit down to answer media questions, want to ask for sympathy. Others have lost friends, still sit and cry, think about their friends, but we have to sit back and check where we were at the time. We also wanted to ask for sympathy, we couldn't answer much because we didn't see when he fell, the flask blamed himself, who didn't take good care of his friend, but we wanted to have our own time. That's it. There's nothing more to it than that. He also said that Watermelon knew Robert and Job would be on the trip because he was the one who told it, which he didn't care about when asked if society was asking questions about accepting the job. We don't understand how it came about. We told the police and confirmed that there was no point in fighting to push him into the water because we loved him so much. He adopted our child and had to understand that if he died, the flask would also disappear. He's always helped us, and we're like smashing our own pots of rice. The part where the flask doesn't call mom is that we're not that close to mom, we're closer to dad, but we understand that mom is angry, and mom isn't that big of a deal to help us there. When asked who wrote the name of the watermelon to the police that day, San said that he was the one who wrote it, but did not write watermelon nida because we did not follow up on him changing his name, he knew what he wrote, and he wrote it like that. We then informed anyone who could help us 191 and called a friend on land to help. There is the best proof of call at that time. The rescue part said there was no information, this is puzzled why the rescue said no information because there is evidence that he called us 3 times and we told them all and it took a very long time to arrive. He explained that at that time the boat was not driving fast, we were lying on our mobile phones, which we focused on the phone, we only knew that Mo was getting up and losing the main, and then we screamed and shouted to the watermelon to fall in the water. After finding out, we asked what was going on, we didn't ask a lot because it was a waste of time, we went to work on finding more, which we didn't know there was a toilet in the boat. Even though we had to go to the bathroom at the restaurant, we didn't wear life jackets because we were wearing robes, when taking photos, we still had to take them off, so we didn't wear them because we wanted to take beautiful photos when we asked if we knew the login code. Flask insists that he doesn't know, because he's not good at these things, and watermelons are quite jealous of anyone. Every time we take a picture, we hand it to him to press or he tells us, we only know at that time, believe it or not, let the law confirm our friend's things. Not only lost as for phone inquiries. After the incident, Zane said it was in the bag. Confirm that the truth will appear. We don't touch or touch it because it belongs to our friends. I gave it back to the housekeeper and it was over while the police officer added that the phone matter. It can be proven by science when asked if the rescuers have confirmed that they have arrived. Flask clarified that it is a waste of time to provide information because the equipment he does not have, and then we point out, in our opinion, that we do not need to know who he is. We don't see his tools. We had a boat, we went out to find each other, shouting loudly in case mom claimed that a friend tried to call mom and tell her to turn off the news. This needs to be pointed out by my mother. Zane, meanwhile, insists he doesn't know.

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 Tablet and Laptop Review in One|Microsoft Surface Pro 8 is a tablet that comes with Windows 11, Microsoft's latest operating system. After trying Microsoft Surface Pro 8 for a while. This tablet is considered quite easy to carry and quite convenient. It weighs just 891 grams on a 13-inch screen, and when combined with accessories like the Microsoft Surface Pro Signature Keyboard and Microsoft Surface Slim Pen 2, it doesn't make it any heavier. Therefore, portable and comfortable, the SPONSORED body has a modern design. My favorite thing about the design of Microsoft Surface Pro 8 is the durable, sturdy Kickstand. In fact, it must be said that the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 has a screen size of 13 inches with a resolution of 2880x1920 pixels. The good point is that it supports a 120Hz refresh rate, which is an important and common feature in high-end smartphones. If users want to use Microsoft Surface Pro 8 as a laptop, they can do so. The disadvantage of this is that this part must be purchased separately from the Surface Pro 8 package for 6,990 baht. Selling at 9,990 baht, the unit comes with a front and rear camera, with a rear camera with a resolution of 10 megapixels. When it comes to practical use, it doesn't really work with the rear camera. BECAUSE WHAT IS USED REGULARLY IS THE FRONT CAMERA WITH A RESOLUTION OF 5 MEGAPIXELS. It's used for Zoom or Google Meet meetings, and Microsoft Teams, to be honest, isn't very active. The overview of using the front camera of Microsoft Surface Pro 8 during the meeting is ok, doing reasonably well in low light conditions, but in reverse view. In online meetings Users don't expect to have a sharp front-facing camera, so just to see the face value is fine.Microsoft Surface Pro 8 It operates under the factory Windows 11 operating system, which Windows 11 is an operating system that Microsoft has modernized. You can read the Windows 11 review here: Windows 11 Review, the new operating system from Microsoft is prettier, but the filling is also Windows 10SPONSOREDMicrosoft Surface Pro Signature Keyboard. If you look at the name of the material, it is considered strong and durable. Although when we press the touchpad, we hear some mechanical sounds, but it does not bother much, although the Microsoft Surface Pro Signature Keyboard works well, but it must be explained here that it is an accessory, not included with the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 package. Users will have to pay extra if they want to use this accessory. If you want to use Microsoft Surface Pro 8 as a laptop, not just a tablet, the price of Microsoft Surface Pro Signature Keyboard accessories, if it is a model without a pen, is available at 6,990 baht, but if you have Microsoft Surface Slim Pen 2, the price will go up to 9,990 baht. Microsoft Surface Pro Signature Keyboard is not included in the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 package, the initial price of the unit is 39,590. Baht is considered high, so it may be counted as another disadvantage as well. Compared to a competitor's high-end tablet, which makes it one of the cheaper prices, there's no denying that Microsoft Surface Pro 8 is one of Microsoft's best tablets. Plenty of supported ports There's a strong chipset. Enough battery to perform normal daily operations Also, if we have enough funds to buy accessories, it will make the use even more enjoyable, but the starting price of Microsoft Surface Pro 8 is not at the original low level of 39,590. Therefore, it will increase the user's budget even further for the user group suitable for Microsoft Surface Pro 8.
Apple cuts iPhone SE capacity by 20 percent because demand is lower than expected|iPhone SE, Apple's latest smartphone There is a 20 percent chance of a 20 percent reduction in capacity, mainly due to lower-than-estimated demand, according to Nikkei. Asia said in a conversation with a source close to Apple that the iPhone SE 2022 will be reduced by about 20 percent. The first reason is that the demand for iPhone SE is not as high as expected. According to celebrity analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the production cuts of iPhone SE will take place next quarter, so iPhone SE shipments throughout 2022 will be around 15-20 million units. This is a decrease of 25-30 million units due to the uncertainty of the situation between Russia and Ukraine. This may also affect inflation. However, Apple's iPhone SE 2022 production cuts are too early to say that this product has failed and affected the release of new iPhone SE models in the future, but cutting production capacity by 20 percent is a huge number, which could change Apple's future production strategy.sponsored Source: TechCrunch, CNBC

There are social media, which operate in such a way, such as Diaspora and Steemit, for example, but there is a question mark that if there is a greater community of users, there will be a lot of social media. Will these platforms still cope as well as they used to?

Galaxy Z has already gone in some countries, samsung's official website in some European countries, including Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, has changed the model name from the original Galaxy Z Flip3 and Galaxy Z Fold3 to Galaxy Flip3 and Galaxy Fold3. It doesn't just happen on Samsung's website. But the packaging of the Galaxy Flip3 and Galaxy Fold3 also cuts out the Z, which is why Samsung has to exclude the Z from the Galaxy Z Series name. This often appears on tanks. The significance of the letter Z is used in many meanings today, but the most commonly used is probably in terms of patriotism and support for Vladimir Putin. IN THE INVASION OF UKRAINE, SPONSORED FOR THAT REASON, SAMSUNG, WHICH EXPRESSED ITS INTENTION TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA'S BUSINESS, HAS BEEN FORCED TO DO SO. Therefore, it must cut off any links that have the potential to cause the brand to be involved in supporting the Russian government. It's unclear whether the brand name will be cancelled. Will Galaxy Z be a policy that applies only in certain European countries, or will it expand globally?

"SLS", a powerful rocket that sends "Artemis" into deep space. Take humans back to the moon.|More than 50 years have been waiting for humans to finally return to the moon. With new spacecraft like Orion and the most powerful SLS rocket, 2022 marks the big year of the space exploration program run by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which has announced its goal of bringing humans back to the moon. Under the Artemis program, four selected astronauts will be deployed to Orion, a spacecraft designed to replace a spaceship that was discontinued more than 10 years ago. Travel in space faster and go further than the Apollo. Which is to travel to the moon. The Saturn 5 used in Apollo was the source of the development of the SLS: Spacw Launch System, as well as the newly developed launch base and control center. For deep space exploration missions or far away from earth orbit. .SPONSORED Artemis Project Taking humans to the depths of space The Artemis project is a continuation of the spirit of taking humans to the depths of space, wanting to take humans to Mars. It is necessary to have a spacecraft suitable for long journeys in space. It can accommodate four astronauts, and since the Apollo program era, there have been no more U.S. spacecraft used for long-distance travel. With the decommissioning of the space shuttle, the U.S. is relying on Russia's Soyus spacecraft. Until it was just able to send astronauts themselves through private services. Like SpaceX, which takes astronauts to the International Space Station. By Crew Dragon 2 spacecraft and the first pin if going to Mars, the halfway point should start is to return to the moon. The Artemis project then took the wood to bring humans back to explore the moon. After the Apollo 17 program departed from the Moon in 1972, what did NASA need for a powerful and capable new rocket capable enough to carry the new Orion spacecraft into orbit above the Moon? Liquid fuels like liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen It is equipped with the same RS-25 liquid fuel engine installed in the space shuttle. Four engines with a total thrust of £8.8 million Another important part of the SLS is the 5-part solid-fuel booster rocket, which is a white bar rocket used in the space shuttle program, which takes the main casing parts from the old 4-part booster used in the space shuttle project. Introducing a new flight control system The lighter insulation material delivers 25% better thrust performance than the previous model, but there is no parachute recovery system when returning to Earth. The booster rocket has enough to launch into space 8 times because it has stock from an old rocket from the space shuttle program to be used to launch SLS, i.e. 8 times only when the rocket enters space, the main part of the rocket will be removed. The Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage is isolated, equipped with an RL-10 engine that uses liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Above is the orion installation, which consists of a capsule module that is home to astronauts with a life support system. The SLS rocket has been developed into 3 main phases: Block 1 for Artemis 1-3, while Block 1B rockets will be used on artemis 4-8 missions and Block 2 will be deployed since Artemis 9.21 gateway It has a thrust of £8.8m. The Block 2, which is currently under development, will provide up to £9.2 million of thrust, with both a separate version for delivering manned vehicles and a cargo model for Artemis' mission. 1 Scheduled to travel in 2022 will be an astronaut-free flight, but using operational control from ground center to travel to orbit the moon and launch tiny satellites. The 10 CubeSats test the readiness of Orion, an SLS rocket, to travel into space and return to Earth. Florida, total distance 1.3 million miles. Over the course of 4-6 weeks, Artemis 2's mission will follow in the footsteps of Apollo 8, which will take four astronauts into orbit around the moon, the farthest journey from Earth and safely back to Earth. TAKING ABOUT 10 DAYS TO SPONSORED, ARTEMIS 3'S MISSION WILL TAKE HUMANS TO LAND ON THE MOON FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THE APOLLO SPACECRAFT. 17 Humans were brought to the moon more than 50 years ago, with female astronauts also being brought to the moon. It is also a test of a new lunar landing system that will connect Orion to the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) and the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) that will be like a small space station with the lunar landing craft at Lunar Gateway that will orbit over the moon. gateway Key parts of the Artemis project The 30-day mission to Artemis 1 to the moon is a journey from Earth to the moon to assess the travel safety of the Orion craft and the operation of the European Service Module. Contact with the craft will be made through the NASA Deep Space Network or NASA Deep Space Network. 1 It will enter orbit around the Moon, about 100 km from the surface, to collect data of the craft when traveling in space. This causes the craft to be thrown back to Earth. As it approaches Earth, the capsule shakes off the service craft before friction into the Earth at a speed of 25,000 miles per hour, or 11 km per second. The SLS rocket was mounted on Cape Canaveral's 39B launch base in preparation for the final ground test: adding liquid fuel to the storage tank and draining fuel from the storage tank in extreme cold conditions (if anyone can't imagine, think of the movie Apollo 13, which has a tube connected to the rocket and a white cold vapor covering the rocket until it forms a sheet of ice). If tested at this point, it will be the final process to determine the next launch date for the rocket into space. If everything goes according to plan, we'll see the world's most powerful rocket launch. After Saturn 5 sent Apollo to the moon more than 50 years ago, if Artemis 1's test flight is successful, it will definitely see Artemis 2 with four astronauts in orbit. In 2023-2024, NASA has reiterated that it will be the farthest human journey from Earth since sending a manned spacecraft into space, breaking the Apollo 13 record for a detour behind the moon to return to Earth.

Propose another level of measures In September 2021, the European Union proposed to standardize devices for smartphones and tablets. European Parliament members voted 43 to 2 to approve the expansion of USB-C ports as a central standard to other devices such as laptops, portable game consoles, cameras and other future devices in the field of smartphones. It explains that because they take environmental standards into account, consumers have to buy multiple chargers. For many devices, it has a huge impact on the generation of e-waste.

As has happened with smartphones and tablets, the EU will now allow a vote on this proposal in May. If all goes well, European Parliament members will start talking to EU member states about further action. Source: Android AuthoritySPONSORED

Sony's PlayStation 5 (PS5) shipments missed target Amid chipset shortages|Sony reports its latest fiscal year results Interestingly, PlayStation 5 (PS5) shipments have reached 19.3 million units, but overall sales are below the previous estimate. Sony's fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, has an interesting issue for gamers: the delivery of the much-sought-after game console PlayStation 5 worldwide over the past two years has sold 19.3 million units, when you break down the shipments over the 12 months of fiscal year 2021, ps5 has a total of 11.5 million units, which is lower than Sony's previous target of 14.8 million units. Missing the target of 3.3 million units, the main problem that prevented Sony from achieving its target was due to the shortage of chipsets in the technology industry, which has been a major problem since the covid-19 pandemic. Sony is also optimistic that with the PlayStation 5 being a console with a long service life, it has the potential to surpass PlayStation 4's sales in the future. Sony estimates that chipset shortages should improve over the next fiscal year, estimating shipments of PS5 units for the next fiscal year at 18 million units. BUT IF THE CHIPSET SHORTAGE DOESN'T IMPROVE, THERE'S A STRONG CHANCE THAT SONY'S NUMBERS WON'T MEET THE TARGET AGAIN. There's another thing Sony might be facing: threats from competitors like Microsoft, which owns Xbox platforms with Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, as they have topped their portfolio of game producer studios over the past two years.

List of MPs of the Bhumjaithai Party (PHP) As chairman of the Subcommittee on Space Affairs for Economy and Security (KMDHDES), he said that the development of space affairs in Thailand is the current government organization for space affairs. Failure to share information will hinder the development of space affairs for younger generations who are interested but do not have access to difficult information. Do things that are easy to access with an open data platform that students can easily access. BUT THE THAI SPACE AGENCY HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT, SUCH AS HAVING TO DO OFFICIAL COOPERATION IN ORDER TO OPEN OR PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. He said one way to solve the problem now is not to wait for the government because it could lead to chasing other countries. The private sector should provide support. Private sector organizations may help promote research funding instead, which does not cost much money but is worth getting valuable personnel, because if we support research in space affairs for high school and university students, we will get people in all disciplines of science and engineering. Telecommunications, Electronics, Materials Science Energy and more Today, the construction of small satellites, or cubesats, has many levels of research and requires much less capital. Worthwhile in supporting and investing in Setthapong He said he would advise Thai youth not to wait because they can learn from online media such as YouTube, where they can find kits to practice creating cubesat at affordable prices. Teachers can start learning with their students. More importantly, there must be an initiative to create a small research group, Cubesat. And today, there are quite a few Thai youths who do Cubesat projects within schools without relying on the government. Although only one school has successfully launched their satellites into space and made contact with Earth. Some schools can't shoot into space. It can only be tested at a certain altitude. The Cubesat project does not have the end goal of getting a good satellite, but the end goal is to get a good engineer. I advise you to stop thinking about it, because you will waste years accessing and documenting. I recommend high schools and universities to start on their own, because knowledge is at your fingertips. Rely on government organizations as little as possible because there are difficult procedures to access, as it has been the regulation of the world in the past. Traditional procedures can no longer be used to develop for the future. I suggest that high school kids find information on the internet, which includes free online course information, without having to wait to ask the agency responsible for space. It's just creating obstacles and acting as an innovation control organization, not an innovation advocacy organization, and if this continues, we'll still have to hire foreign companies to produce satellites for us forever."

Reporter Netflix revealed: There are plans to make more changes to the way they present their content. While Netflix's new approach may not be evident anytime soon, it is believed that Netflix filmmaking will be more prudent than what has been seen over the past decade. Netflix They don't call themselves film companies or TV series producers, but they see themselves as tech companies with the amount of money they have on hand, from various sources of financing, so Netflix doesn't have to appease movie distributors or movie theaters, and it also has a user analytics system, something that competitors still lag behind Netflix. What you can see is Netflix's wide range of content to please its large user base. The key point is that Netflix movies aren't doing well enough. Quality is not related to quantity, and the choice of movies to make Netflix makes poor decisions on this issue. COMPARED TO HOLLYWOOD FILM COMPANIES, WHICH CHOSE TO MAKE BIG-NAME FILMS BECAUSE THEY OFFER BETTER RETURNS AND BETTER DECISIONS THAN SPONSORED. It will affect animated movies or TV series because animation requires high investment but low returns. Because animated and family films are already a job that Disney is good at, it's hard for Netflix to compete with Disney in this genre.

Vr application developers on Meta's platform are not satisfied. The latter is charged a high fee of 30 percent.|Application developers on meta's virtual reality platform expressed their displeasure. Facebook has been unhappy with the same fees from Apple, which has declared that the Metaverse is their future, with billions of dollars invested each year. That's because the platform doesn't yet own the market. Unlike the smartphone business, where Apple and Google control the market, meta is a good environment. It requires the cooperation of external developers to help build applications for the entire ecosystem. Whether the hardware and software are moving at the same time, however, there is a problem. When developers of virtual reality applications start making noises, they are already expressing some dissatisfaction. Meta, as the owner of the Quest Store platform, charges developers 15-30 percent of the application fees, the same figure that Meta has expressed displeasure with google and apple's fees on iOS and AndroidSPONSORED, while some quest store developers say that the quest store experience is not good at all, and the management is worse than iOS and Android. This figure is not comparable to the 19 million downloads on the Quest Store for virtual reality and augmented reality hardware development. In the near future, we should see Apple come down to this market as well. Microsoft also has the HoloLens platform, which has been developed over the years.

Gartner estimates smartphone-PC exports are declining. From inflation and lockdown problems in China|The announcement of a lockdown in China, as ordered by Beijing. Gartner, a research and marketing consulting firm, released a new report. Inflation problems, he said. China's lockdown and economic slowdown China is one of the largest markets for PC and smartphone businesses, but in 2022, a large market like China will shrink, according to Gartner's estimate, which believes shipments are likely to drop by about 18 percent, supported by Beijing's strict lockdown. As a result, economic activity does not occur in the global market segment. Gartner believes smartphone shipments are likely to drop by about 7 percent due to supply chain problems, which are chain problems caused by Beijing's lockdown and the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Another major reason for the decline in demand for smartphones is an analysis of the situation of the PC market. Gartner estimates shipments have fallen by around 9.5 percent after strong growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past two years, with declining shipment numbers, it's bad news for companies involved in the business, such as Invidia, Apple and MicrosoftSPONSORED.
Meta issues a letter informing employees of key moments.|Meta executives issue letters to employees in the company. Chris Cox, Meta's chief product officer, wrote an internal note to Meta's employees to highlight and remind that Meta is at a very critical moment and must be prepared for the difficult situation that will arise in the second half of 2022. Meta employees also need to carry out their plans error-free. This means that Meta's employees shouldn't expect big budget support or new employees to join the team.

"Game Changer" as 6G approaches|Recently, the Chinese government-backed Purple Mountain Laboratories Institute said its research team successfully delivered 6G signals at 206.25 Gbps for the first time, in collaboration with local telecommunications giants, including China Mobile and Fudan University. One of the research team said he used the method of streaming data through the use of "Vortex millimetre waves," which are high-frequency radio waves that transmit swirling data. Installed at the Beijing Winter Olympic Stadium, it appears that more than 10,000 high-definition live videos can be streamed simultaneously. IT STREAMS 1 TERABYTE 3,300-FOOT DATA IN 1 SECOND"THE SUCCESS CREATES A NEW DIMENSION OF WIRELESS TRANSMISSION, WHERE SPIRAL TRANSMISSION IS DIFFERENT FROM DATA TRANSMISSION IN THE LAST CENTURY." Prof Chow said the excitement of 6G technology is that it can develop weapons and defense systems by testing to prove that weapons with up to 5 times the speed of supersonic can use 6G for targeting and communication. For the military, efficiency is more important than the price, but commercial use may have to wait until 2030 or a little sooner. Experts from the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering Tsinghua University explained, adding that the spiral wave transmission resembles a tornado, a 3D pattern, said Chinese government researchers studying 6G technology in Shenzhen. Such experiments could be the "beginning of a revolution" in the world's communication technology this decade, with 6G being a game changer that will transform the world and radically transform the services of technology. Because even during the experiment, it is estimated that the speed of 6G is 100 times faster than 5G. The researchers speculate that 6G speeds could be 8,000 times faster than 5G, or 142 hours of movies can be downloaded in 1 second, or 3D concerts that can be performed live around the world. Another interesting aspect of 6G is that when the AI system runs through the application for a while, it begins to learn on its own, such as learning to drive a vehicle, learning about agriculture, and when it accumulates enough knowledge afterwards, it will make its own decisions. Through internet connectivity, unforeseen things can happen, such as driving an autonomous car with AI without a driver, but relying on instructing the vehicle to drive on the same route. Although it is predicted that we will be able to use 6G in 2030 or about 9 years from now, in reality, we may see 6G sooner amid the rapid changes in future technologies that both major powers like China and the U.S. are accelerating development, as well as South Korea, which has followed closely by investing heavily in R&D in 6G technology.

The company's insiders used to be good, but when digital disrupted quickly and with extreme dynamics, they may have to accelerate their potential to become weak. Despite the company's clear workforce plan, "I still have the challenge of strengthening existing Gen in time so that I can work with new Gen and work happily together... I am constantly questioning myself what more I can do as a leader, which I believe I have, and insist on pushing hard in every way to be better than I have done"Continue to be proud, waiting for the successor to take over the AIS CEO, for the pride angle that has arisen in the past 8 years of AIS CEOs. First, it concludes that it can bring the organization to work professionally through the crisis from the transition from the joint venture system to the license system completely, not being completely shut down at the auction of wave 900 in the first place. "I would like to confirm that even after 8 years, I still have the full power to keep going until my successor can take over. We, myself and tens of thousands of AIS employees are ready to help develop and drive the country's digital economy to the best of our ability." This is the final message of Somchai Lertsuttiwong, who is waiting to see who the new CEO of AIS will be in the future.

Today, space affairs are getting closer to us, both economically and technologically, we need to talk to knowledgeable people so that people can know and bring the next generation of children to experience them with inspiration. We don't lack talent or cost, but we don't have the opportunity to access these things. "Today we have laws but we are still running behind technology, and in the future, laws will play a huge role. In particular, laws relating to information and education must try to make it accessible to the younger generation, and if we do not have the Space Affairs Act, we will not be able to cooperate with countries. We need to make our national policies clear so that they can see and exchange information and technology development with us, because the space economy today is very close to us.

"Seth Phong" Leo satellites are trending, low cost, new communication system alternatives.|"Seth Phong" Pointing out leo satellites, alternative communication systems Low cost-but less lifespan than GEO beware of space overflow debris on Aug. 11, 2022 Dr. Sethapong Malisuwan List of MPs of the Bhumjaithai Party (PHP) As Deputy Commissioner communication According to DES, satellite technology is traditionally in GEO orbit, orbiting at a distance of about 36,500 kilometers above earth, which geostationary (GEO) satellites have been using for decades. But technological evolutions and innovations such as LEO satellites have many advantages. Therefore, leo satellites are increasingly being used in various industries and used for a variety of purposes, but LEO satellites orbiting between 500-2,000 kilometers from earth have limited coverage horizons. Therefore, a large number of LEO satellites are needed to be able to completely cover the earth's surface. "The equipment of leo satellites is now much smaller than before. A new concept was developed and aimed at size, capabilities and cost, a small satellite called CubeSat was developed that enabled the satellite and space industry. It has evolved and grown significantly over the past two decades. As a result, the demand for LEO satellites has increased, making LEO satellites suitable for use in various industries such as internet service. It is used as a communication device in telecommunications systems, such as iridium telephone systems that use LEO satellites to monitor and observe the Earth. This makes it possible to see the earth's surface more clearly. Used in logistics and transportation industries. In division, find the geographical location. Sponsored Col. Sethapong said that LEO satellites must communicate with ground stations in the most efficient way in order to make LEO satellites available in a variety of applications, but most of them are intended for mobile communication. From coverage from communication signals from ground infrastructure such as communications in oil and natural gas drilling sites. Therefore, LEO satellite services are used for exploration. Connecting to the Internet Voice communication and even tracking and monitoring hardware and devices. In addition, when natural disasters occur, such as earthquakes, floods, and storms, this can damage the communication infrastructure. Therefore, satellite communication services are used to coordinate emergency assistance via satellite, which may be the only service that can be used or even used in recreational purposes, for example, for those who like to sail, drive a car or walk to remote destinations if an unexpected event occurs. But on the other hand, LEO satellites have disadvantages due to the ease of launch and the growing popularity of these satellites, which causes the problem of space debris to increase, which is why space agencies often need to use multiple layers of protective shields to protect against space debris. In addition, conventional LEO satellites tend to have a much lower service life than GEO satellites," Sethapong said.

Research reveals Gen Z teens are starting to step back from Facebook, but Instagram is still popular.|Gen Z is increasingly accessing the internet. But this group of teenagers is likely to stop using Facebook because they haven't found value on the platform, but there's still some good news. As Instagram continues to dominate adolescents, the Pew Research Center has released an interesting study on the social media habits of adolescents, particularly in Gen Z. Only 32 percent of teens aged 13-17 use Facebook, in contrast to the figures collected in 2014-15. Teenage consumers also have more options to use media platforms than ever before. As a result, Facebook is no longer the first and only choice for users. Although Facebook is not the number one platform in the minds of Jade Z people, Instagram, which is managed by Meta, the same company as Facebook, has become a very popular platform for teenagers. The number of teens using Instagram is now 62 percent, up from a 2014-15 survey, when only 52 percent of teens were active. With 95 percent of the numbers, it's just YouTube. It is not a platform that is directly related to the creation of interactions much. Because YouTube is ultimately used in a way that is used for watching videos, including listening to music through YouTube Music, TikTok has a higher usage number than both Facebook and Instagram, which should be enough to make it clear why Meta wants to create its own ecosystem similar to TikTok, as evidenced by the efforts to push the Reels feature to appear on both Instagram and Facebook. That's an addiction to social media, as well as being too attached to a smartphone. 45 percent of respondents said they had no problem with social media. While 36 percent admit to using social media too much and 8 percent who say they use too little social media, Source: TechCrunch

Samsung assures foldable mobiles to be the new standard by 2025|The success of Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 3 has resulted in Samsung releasing sequels like Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Galaxy Z Flip 4 with confidence. The Korea Herald reports that TM Roh, chief executive in Samsung's smartphone business "By 2025, foldable smartphones will account for 50 percent of all shipments of Samsung's premium smartphones," TM said at a news conference in New York this week. Samsung has become a leader in the foldable smartphone business, with sales of Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 3 selling a combined 7.1 million units. The resulting sales are mainly galaxy Z Flip 3 sales. While the overall sales of the entire world of foldable phones are estimated at 9 million units, of course, so far the figure of 7.1 million units is considered a small sales figure. This is especially true when compared to Samsung's smartphone shipments throughout 2021, which totaled 271.5 million units. Most of them are primarily mid-range smartphones, and the low-cost smartphones, while the Galaxy S21, released last year, has done well. Galaxy S22 Ultra has shipped around 20-25 million units, and recently it was reported that the Galaxy S22 Ultra has shipped 11 million units. As a result, about 30 percent of samsung's premium smartphones have been shipped, so the 50 percent figure that Samsung has set is unlikely to happen.

However, in the list of tweets. Part of the reason for the decrease in viewership is because of the ad system, which annoys viewers, resulting in the search term "How to block tweet ads". On Google SearchSPONSORED, Facebook Gaming is the most affected platform because, on the one hand, Facebook Gaming is the least popular gaming streaming platform. With fewer and fewer views, down 28 percent since last quarter and down 51 percent from a year earlier, YouTube Gaming is the only platform that has maintained a strong audience. It has managed to maintain an audience of about 1.13 billion hours from the beginning of the year to the last quarter. However, this figure is 13.1 percent less than the previous year's overall figure, a major reason for the continued decline in gaming streaming views. The reason is that lockdown restrictions have been loosened. Moreover, more and more people are starting to come out and go about their daily lives as they were before the COVID-19 pandemic. So what we see now should be called a return to normal.

Instagram is also secondary to TikTok in the short video battleground.|Meta internal documents Instagram's parent company It shows that attempts to knock down a tick-to-a have not worked. Despite losing millions of dollars, the opposite has caused a lot of outrage among celebrities, the Wall Street Journal reported. The report claims that there is an internal document by Meta about Instagram's efforts to combat tick-to-a, which at this time saw a decrease in engagement on Instagram Reels compared to Tik-to-k. The number of views of TikTok reaches 197.8 million hours per day, but Instagram is only 17.6 million hours. Even in reality, meta Instagram's parent company is making a desperate effort to beat TikTok. $1 billion has been allocated to creators. A spokesperson for Meta, speaking to The Verge news agency, responded to the Wall Street Journal's report, saying the comparison data was inaccurate. He argued that in fact, the number of views via Reels is increasing, while Instagram has updated the application to become more tick-to-be. But in the end, it was attacked by celebrities. Eventually, the main problem with Instagram Reels lies in the lack of original content, with nearly a third of the content appearing on Reels being created from other platforms. AS CAN BE SEEN FROM THE WATERMARK INSIDE THE CLIP, ALTHOUGH INSTAGRAM HAS TRIED TO REDUCE THE VISIBILITY OF THESE CONTENT, IT HAS NOT WORKED. I would also like to continue to present this approach. At this time, meta is in the process of developing algorithms to offer content that resonates with users. Source: WSJ, The Verge

Overlook shots. When Twitter is in the hands of Elon Musk|Elon Musk's decision to re-acquire Twitter is an interesting issue. When we see Musk's reversal, before the Delaware court proceedings, it must be said that Twitter and Musk He is scheduled to appear in a Delaware court hearing. Elon Musk argues that Twitter is a platform with too many bots and spam accounts, which has many reasons to speculate about its withdrawal from the deal, especially regarding the economy and the stagnation of the cryptocurrency market. It must be said that it is the best possible option because it is already taken into account. When it comes to opening documents on both sides by a Delaware court. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MUSK'S SIDE IS AT A DISADVANTAGE. Musk's legal team made it clear that musk's legal team was at a disadvantage, so Musk tried to raise his earphones and pressed the button to move forward with the acquisition again after Musk returned to the stage of acquiring Twitter. Twitter and Elon Musk's trial have been temporarily postponed to allow Musk to collect money for the Twitter acquisition, but the judge has framed the takeover as to be completed by 5 p.m. on Oct. 28. The trial will continue in November in this case, and I'd like to point out that when the deal between Elon Musk and Twitter is over, it's over. What's going to happen next, I think, is what Musk will have to do, and then urgently do it: buy the hearts of Twitter employees, because we must not forget that Musk is someone who cannot predict anything. His decisions, from multiple tweets to Twitter tweets, are unsettling. No matter how. When Musk owns Twitter He must build faith in his own employees at the same time. Musk was so concerned about fake bot-accounts that he used it as an excuse to overturn a deal. When that day comes, actually. Musk's handling of this part will continue to express the same concerns as he did on Twitter at the same time. Many more outsiders I'm waiting to question Musk's freedom of expression. I used to say it on the day I wanted to take over Twitter. What is it and how do it work? Musk has owned Twitter for a while. Progress in this section has already been made, followed by the issue of how twitter's algorithm should look open-source. Whether or not it gives users the opportunity to customize their algorithms in their own way, or whether they are free to use Twitter's algorithms, these are all interesting questions. It's about the ecosystem that surrounds Twitter in the era of Elon Musk. Elon Musk has reopened the Buy Twitter button. He talked about platform X, which is not clear what it is. All you need to know is that platform X is everything (which doesn't make you know anything more). WeChat has become a model, i.e. the WeChat application. It's an app that is everything from chat, web browser, and a full-fledged app that spends on goods and services, so it's possible that Twitter in Elon Musk's era could do anything similar to WeChat. However, one thing that I think Musk will adopt the approach of the same Twitter executives is the so-called Twitter BlueSPONSORED. He wants Twitter to have multiple revenue streams, one of which is under a system called subscription. The point at which Musk and his team will have to crystallize is what functionality Twitter Blue should have, so that twitter users who don't have to pay for it and then use that money to nourish Twitter to survive without having to rely on advertising systems. There's still a subtlety to think about: Will Musk still have time to manage Twitter? Today, Musk manages Tesla and SpaceX and many other smaller companies. The most straightforward and obvious question is whether Musk can still handle multitasking perfectly (?), or will Musk finally find a solution to this by hiring a professional executive to manage Twitter in his place. It's an interesting topic for both Elon Musk and the future of Twitter.References: The Verge, TechCrunch, The GuardianSPONSORED

Technology Experts Disappointed metaverse world after spending over 15 billion|Meta has invested more than $15 billion to build the metaverse since the beginning of last year. It's still ambiguous as to what areas are being developed. Technology experts I'm disappointed at the metaverse. Last week, Meta hosted Meta Connect, the latest meta movement on the metaverse universe, which has now spent more than $150 billion or about 580 billion baht. About $5 billion has been spent this year, meta metaverse investments through a division called Reality Labs, which has been going on since the beginning of last year. Ais, a technology analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, commented that the metaverse is still a risk to Zuckerberg and his team. Because now they're putting a lot of money into betting on the future. Meanwhile, their core business is facing quite a bit of trouble at the same time. Iss admits that pricing the expensive Meta Quest Pro of U.S. $1,500 is a very high launch price, making it possible for high-end customers to reach only high-end customers. And it's not suitable for the average customer. This makes it harder to enter the metaverse on Mark Zigutovic's side. Benmark analysts say they are unaware of the spending of money on metaverse, but believe at least 60 percent will be spent on research and development to create a new virtual world that Mark Zuckerberg dreamed of. Sikutovic has made one more interesting point: at this time, meta is in trouble that they are not in a position to buy an interesting software company to complement the metaverse world. That's because the Supervisory Board has been closely monitoring every meta movement when someone disagrees with Mark. Zuckerberg, on the issue of creating the metaverse, must have someone to agree with, one of which is Ivan Fineseth. An analyst at Tigress Financial Partners said he believes in Mark's long-term vision of the metaverse. Zuckerberg cited as an example that on the day Facebook acquired Instagram, a lot of people laughed at him and said that Zuckerberg was crazy for throwing away so much money. But today, Instagram has become one of the great acquisition deals not just for Facebook, but for one of the world's best acquisition deals Source: Business Insider

As a result, production has dropped significantly. Recognize and acknowledge that the demand for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max is very high.

If Apple can fix this section, that demonstrates Apple's superiority to Google.

Government of India Aiming to create its own operating system called IndOS reduces dependence on Android.|Government of India The idea was to create its own smartphone operating system called IndOS, with the main reason being to reduce reliance on Google Business's Android operating system. Standard, a local news agency in India It was revealed, citing high-level sources in the Indian government. India is one of the major markets for smartphones, he said. They want to create their own operating system, focusing on security, new alternatives, and reducing the chances of Android dominance. From Google, IndOS, of course, developing the operating system itself is not easy, and it seems that the Indian government's plans have been quiet. The main reason is because developing an operating system is not easy. For example, Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system. In the end, it failed, leaving only iOS and Android in the smartphone operating system competition. Only two brands in particular. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars to buy Nokia, but it has also failed to do so, while HarmoneyOS, developed by Huawei, has failed to become the third choice in the sponsored operating system market. That has made mobile operating systems a dream for the Indian government. It's probably a matter of developers and smartphone manufacturers having the tiredness of having to face the excessive diversity of operating systems because, in fact, having only iOS and Android is probably the perfect fit at this time. The concept of building an Indian government operating system This is partly because India wants to fight the monopoly of Big Tech companies that are emerging in Bharata, especially in Google's list source: The RegisterSPONSORED.
Chong Km.DES Study and build low-orbit satellites and develop them into the space business.|"Sethapong" reveals the Space Affairs Subcommittee Chong KMT DES Study on the construction of low-orbit satellites, further development into the space business, pointing out the benefits of both communication - medical - disaster warning, hastening to make a summary of the submission to the council meeting on January 21, 2023.

The development of relevant technologies coupled with changing consumer behavior. As a result, operators in the satellite industry need to adapt and develop technology to accommodate such changes. It will be able to revive the business situation and the space economy even better. In particular, the satellite services sector continued to decline in revenue. At present, there are many companies that develop and provide low-orbit satellites because they can be used in a variety of ways. He said that in the past, communication satellites would be used for broadcasting services such as international or intercontinental transmissions, such as live football matches via satellite. In addition to technology, it will meet the needs of use. Development costs are getting lower and competition is becoming more competitive. Especially when used in conjunction with the Ka-band band with a higher frequency range, satellites can generate more bandwidth, lower cost per capacity, and improved signal quality that is almost comparable to the terrestrial network. In addition, the development of reusable rocket technology and the production of smaller, lower-cost satellites. This has resulted in the creation of a larger NGSO satellite network, or Satellite Constellation, occurring rapidly. Dr. Amarin Pimnoo, Advisor to the Space Affairs Subcommittee, said that the subcommittee considered that there should be experiments and construction of satellites in order to learn what more needs to be used and how to develop further. The nation will be at a disadvantage. Therefore, the NGO proposed a pilot project to start the development of LEO Constellation satellites for the benefits of telemedicine and emergency assistance, which will contribute to human life, as well as learning about LEO Constellation satellite technology, human resource development, craft development and job creation and uplifting of people in the country.

The last is the word understand the world, because ever since the world learned about the Industrial Revolution, humans have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the air. What follows is the problems that the world faces today, from different temperatures to man-made waste such as plastic. Innovation development must therefore be aware of efforts not to interfere with global resources.

With monthly active users reaching 10 million within three years, it caught the eye of tech giant Facebook, which acquired the business in 2014 for over $19 billion. Analysts see the growth of WhatsApp as an indirect competitor to Messenger, facebook-affiliated chat platform. A video streaming platform that radically changes people's media viewing habits. Starting in 1998, its main business was DVD rental, and in 2007 launched a video streaming platform called Watch Now. At the time, Netflix was the only one that offered unlimited video streaming and DVD rental services for as little as $10, a business model that offered cheaper entertainment options to embrace the future of internet growth while maintaining its existing customer base. In 2009, the number of subscribers surpassed 10 million.4.Instagram, a social media with the feature of sharing media, allows users to upload photos and videos and share them to form a community.

Smart chatbots that can interact with humans naturally. Launched in November 2022, just five days after opening, it has reached 1 million users, and the latest data from the Similar Web reveals 10 million active daily users. In just 40 days. Other platforms spend a year trying to get a catalyst for popularity: AI's ability to process data and interact with humans. In addition to being compared to media play from the media to google search engines, there is a growing demand for experiments. This rapid growth wasn't ChatGPT that was just going to be the first platform, but actually back in 2011 when Google launched social media platform Google Plus, built to knock out competitors like Facebook at the time. Just 16 days after its launch, it surpassed 10 million users, but has steadily declined in user traffic, trying to establish itself as a social media hub that combines all features into one platform, making no difference from its competitors. There are also too many user interfaces that look like they're putting more products into the user's hands than necessary. This does not meet the real needs. This is one of the reasons why Google Plus shut down in 2019SPONSORED. The benefits that users receive are the main factors that contribute to the growth of those platforms, while monetization models and their use to increase business efficiency are important factors in attracting investments, both of which must be in the same direction and in parallel with wired , theguardian , reuters , cnet , mastories , investopedia.

Why has the arrival of ChatGPT shaken the AI industry?|OpenAI, an artificial intelligence (AI) technology research and development company, recently officially launched ChatGPT, a new AI chat platform. According to the company, Since ChatGPT launched on social media, there has been debate about the possibility of implementing this innovation, as well as the potential dangers of debug code analysis to the potential for essays for Bern Elliott students. Research Vice President, Gartner Inc., revealed why ChatGPT has attracted so much attention: ChatGPT is a perfect storm that combines two big artificial intelligence (AI) issues that are currently trending: chatbots and GPT3, which offer a way to communicate and create engaging content, as if talking to humans in an amazing way. Some present insightful information and sometimes full of sponsored knowledge, but unfortunately, ChatGPT sometimes presents content incorrectly and is not based on human understanding or intelligence. The problem may lie in the words 'understanding' and 'intelligence', which are based on human input that may have vague, unclear meanings. Therefore, when applied to algorithms, it can result in a serious misunderstanding of a more useful angle to see that chatbots and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT have become valuable tools for accomplishing specific tasks that are not for entertainment purposes. Chatbots already have many usage patterns in their systems. From providing customer service to helping technical teams identify issues for higher-level ChatGPT implementation, it is used as a chatbot that is specific to (chat), interacting or 'chatting' with GPT resources. This means that data can be used in certain situations where errors can be accepted or corrected, with many basic models such as GPT being used in domains including Computer Vision, Software Engineering, and Scientific Research and Development, such as using basic models to create images from text and verifying code from natural language, smart contracts, and even in healthcare such as the creation of new medicines and genome decoding to classify diseases of ethical concerns. THE VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH SEES AI BASIC MODEL MODELS SUCH AS GPT DEMONSTRATING A MAJOR SHIFT IN AI FROM THE UNIQUE BENEFITS IT PROVIDES, SUCH AS REDUCING COSTS AND TIMEFRAME-SPECIFIC MODELING, WHICH INEVITABLY RAISES ETHICAL RISKS AND CONCERNS. Natural Language Processing-NLP, e.g. categorization Trained models can reduce expensive customization and testing costs. It is used to create strategic documentation outlining the benefits, risks, opportunities, and roadmaps for deploying AI-based models such as GPT, which helps determine whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Specific applications use cloud-based APIs to create models and select the smallest models to provide accuracy and efficiency to simplify operations. Reduce energy consumption and increase total cost efficiency for ownership, prioritize vendors that promote responsible model deployment by publishing usage guidelines. Enforcement includes logging known vulnerabilities and weaknesses and proactively exposing malicious behavior and abuse situations.

It has announced the easing of restrictions on chatbotting. AI to achieve a balance with the use of previous causes. Microsoft has been very strict about bing. By requiring only 5 sessions of questions to be asked no more than 50 messages, that's because when users create conversations that are too long, they can't ask questions. As a result, Bing's answer AI is faulty and lacks accuracy at the same time. Microsoft admits that each session with a long and complex chat is not something Microsoft encountered during the testing phase.

Bloomberg reports Apple made big progress in implanting blood sugar test chips on Apple Watch.|Apple is set to add a major update to its health chipset by adding a chip that can detect blood sugar from its Apple Watch over the years. News continues that Apple is testing the introduction of glucose monitoring to its Apple Watch, according to a recent bloomberg news agency. Apple has made significant progress in this regard, believing that the opportunity for the new Apple Watch in the future to come with a blood sugar monitor chip and be available to the market within Apple has called for a development program to monitor blood glucose on the Apple Watch. The project, which involves developing a blood glucose chipset, has been a long-standing project since Steve Jobs was Apple's chief executive, according to Bloomberg. Apple's development of the project is a top-secret project, with hundreds of engineers working diligently on the job, which is part of what Apple calls the Exploratory Design Group, or XDG. He explained that leading technology companies in the past had the idea of improving their ability to monitor blood glucose levels, but it seems that Apple has gone the farthest, with Apple opting for a different approach from other companies by using silicon chips, photonics and an assimilation process called spectroscopy. Then, when the light is reflected back to the sensor, it indicates the concentration of glucose sponsored in the silicon chipset development section. Photonics Apple has hired TSMC, a long-time Apple trading partner, to take over the role to Bloomberg. Apple has experimented with the technology on hundreds of people over the past 10 years with the ultimate aim of raising awareness among people about whether they have diabetes. Although the development of blood sugar monitoring tools is advancing to the point of becoming a key marker for Apple, it is still in the process of proving the concept of whether it is feasible. Apple also had to downsize its chip design to make it as practical and convenient as possible for human use. Nowadays, the size of the prototype is almost the same size as the iPhone for Exploratory Design Group, which has a similar concept to Google X, which focuses heavily on research and development. Apple has invested at least hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in the project.

There are now at least 200 e-books with ChatGPT as an author or co-author since ChatGPT was first released to the public by OpenAI at the end of November 2022. At this time, it was revealed that on Amazon's Kindle Store platform, there are no less than 200 e-books written by ChatGPT, both as writers and co-authors, but amazon's conditions do not clearly indicate whether the books are written by artificial intelligence. Last year, around 1.4 million copies were published on this channel, and amazon, as the owner of the Kindle Store platform, has not put in place any requirements relating to robot writers coming from ChatGPT, including no blocking. If a human writer were to brainstorm with chatbots to create sponsored writings, the problems that might arise afterwards would be the large language models, which are the foundation of Google's ChatGPT and Bard AI development, all trained by man-made content. Although Amazon's policies cannot be changed overnight, there are proponents of the idea that Amazon should have a more explicit label on which books are written by artificial intelligence to provide information to readers, etc. Source: TechRadarSPONSORED

Blizzard However, the Federal Trade Commission viewed the deal as potentially causing unfair competition in the market, prompting Microsoft to apply for legal proceedings to force Sony to disclose some of the game's key documents from PlayStation. Sony has paid game developers to release exclusive games exclusively on PlayStation only, and to stop game studios from developing games on Microsoft's platform, Xbox Game Pass. The FTC's chief judge said Microsoft's petition was heard, with important documents to be disclosed to the court. The disclosure includes a document outlining the figures Sony paid to game studios so that the game would not be published on Microsoft's platform.

Microsoft's request is too much, but it's only for the 2019 acquisition deal with Microsoft's Action Blizzard acquisition.

Microsoft's Action Blizzard deal, with Sony participating, will take place on August 2.

Unlike the Steve Jobs era, the design department reports directly to Jobs at the same time. It has been noted by employees that at this time, the operations department has taken over the development approach of the design department more and more.
